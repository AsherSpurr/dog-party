## What & Why
This static comp allowed me to flex my CSS and HTML skills with comp recreation.
There were no creative liberties given, I was tasked with creating the pixel-perfect copy. This application is not responsive to screen size, we had a 4-hour time block to complete this according to the display of a 13" Macbook Pro.
**This took me 3 hours, roughly 2.5 focused hours, to complete.**

## Side-by-side comparison (Re-creation -> comp)
